Building APIs you users will hate

API antipatterns

1. Secret endpoints
2. Schema changes on same version
3. Push changes whenever you feel like it
    Use semantic versioning and publish roadmap and release schedule
4. Developers call your API again and you break it like a promise
    communicate breaking changes and ensure old versions are available while new versions are released
5. Inconsistent naming
6. Rate limitations that aren't transparent
7. Use meaningful status codes.
