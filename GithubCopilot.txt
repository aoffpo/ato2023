Challenges:
    Should always have human oversight and Reviewing
    only as good as context/prompt
    Learn to do prompt engineering to get best results from it
    Learning curve
    sometimes needs nudging
    Hallucinations - generating things (variables, dependencies) that don't exist
    Date problem
        only as up to date as model was trained on.
            ex. "what is the version of K8.  Answer 1.22 . Actual 1.28
            Chat may have different training date than CoPilot
    Length of response - may not be enough data ex: Zip to state, stops at Ohio
    Always generative, not deterministic
