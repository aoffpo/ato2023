Deep Learning
    neural network with mutliple layers from large amount of data
    content/code gen; summeraization, speech to text ,chatbox, image recognition

Tensor
    multi dimensional array for numeric computation
    primary data type in pytorch

Model parameters
    weights and biases that are optimized during training

Forward Pass
    run the input data through model to make prediction of output

Backward Pass   
    traverse backwards through input data


pytorch 
    framework for  Model    
    building blocks t obuild and train neural network
        takes care of complexities

    computation support for cpu, gpu and distributed training 

    domain specific libraries
        torchvision, torchaudio, torchtext, pytorch mobel (beta)

    torchbench for benchmarking models

--
    Data prep
    torch.nn module
    models inherit from nn.model 

    training loop can be just a few steps
    backwards propagation
        gradiant calculation with autograd
            calculates weights and biases
        model optimization
    python frontend

    Distributed training    
        DistributedDataParallel
            replicates models across cpus 
        Fully Shared Data Parallel (FSCP)
            extends DDP by sharding model parameters, grandient and optimizer states
