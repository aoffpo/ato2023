Data modeling strategies
    understand your queries
        to create partition keys and tables correctly
    Data partitioning
        partition data by states so you don't have to scan the entire country
        secondary indexes if low cardinality
    Denormalization
        ensure duplication across multiple nodes
        balance between denormalization and data consistency
            sophisticated update process to keep data in sync
    time series data modeling
        most use cases ask for data in given time frame (monthly statement)
    Consistency levels
    Materialized views
        aggregate, transform and filter to access data
            ex: spend on a given day

Cassandra Usage in Loyalty (customer points/rewards program)
    Any customer that logs into platform gets data from Cassandra
    transactions table 
        sourced from raw tables 
    Real time use cases
        whenever you need a response as soon as possible, pick partition key close to query 
        start from use case - define partition key - then data 
    Batch
        requires aggregated data
        data in sync
        aggregate by account number and transaction date because we will are working with data ranges PRIMARY KEY ((account_number), transaction_date)

    Real time and batch at same time    
        partition for each use case from raw source data
